# riscv-os
An attempt to create a tiny OS in RISC-V assembly

## Credits
The initial setup and linker file were inspired by
[chuckb/riscv-helloworld](https://github.com/chuckb/riscv-helloworld) project

## References
This is clearly a learning project, so I used a number of sources and
references that helped me to learn the subject. Here are the key ones:

- [Project F - FPGA & RISC-V Tutorials](https://projectf.io/posts/) -
  a collection of great, deep posts by Will Green on various aspects
  of RISC-V assembly programming. It includes a
  [cheat sheet](https://projectf.io/posts/riscv-cheat-sheet/) that I use frequently
- [RISC-V from scratch](https://twilco.github.io/riscv-from-scratch/2019/04/27/riscv-from-scratch-2.html) -
  Tyler Wilcock post on hardware layouts, linker, etc - very detailed!
  Other posts on RISC-V worth checking too.
